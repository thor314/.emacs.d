This looks like an interesting package. Could be useful for generating configs. Not sure if it would require me to reorganize all my org files into a single org document though.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
        (use-package dotcrafter
          :custom
          (dotcrafter-dot-files-folder "~/.dotfiles")
          (dotcrafter-org-files ))
#+end_src
