* 2021-11-25 Do better startup times:
3 main things:
- increase the size of the gc threshold
- Use autoload (defer in use-package) to defer loading libraries. Eg, prefer:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
	(use-package blahy
    ;; autoload on first usage of blah
    :defer t
    ;; run before blah is loaded
    :init (add-hook 'some-hook 'blah-mode)
    ;; is roughly equivalent to, where commands defines autoload conditions for lazy loading.
    :commands (some-hook)
    ;; commands that get run after blah is loaded
    :config
    (setq blah-var "bloop"))
 ;; also see, non-vital packages:
 (use-package recentf
  ;; Loads after 1 second of idle time.
  :defer 1)
#+end_src
- avoid helper functions, eg (yas-global-mode 1); prefer:
* I could be making more complete use of:
CxCx, Mh, M@ - mark stuff
Ccb - bookmarks
list-faces-display
highlight changes mode
selective-display - display only some indentation level
abbrevs with Cxag/l
hs-mode

* Commands
- add-to-list
- package-initialize
- when = if
- not
- <something>-p (predicate)
- (provide 'package-name): for packages
- let (): setq occurs later
eg: (let (beg end) ; explicit assign to beg, end with a setq
(setq beg (region-beginning) end (region-end))
let ((format (cond ; assign to format based on a condition

- fset
- funcall
- description
- save-window-excursion
- switch-to-buffer
- buffer-string


- let (()): value assigned immediately
- let*: lets happen sequentially, not in parallel; allow vars to rely on previous assigns
- let:
