I could be making more complete use of:
CxCx, Mh, M@ - mark stuff
Ccb - bookmarks
list-faces-display
highlight changes mode
selective-display - display only some indentation level
abbrevs with Cxag/l
hs-mode

* Commands
- add-to-list
- package-initialize
- when = if
- not
- <something>-p (predicate)
- (provide 'package-name): for packages
- let (): setq occurs later
eg: (let (beg end) ; explicit assign to beg, end with a setq
(setq beg (region-beginning) end (region-end))
let ((format (cond ; assign to format based on a condition

- fset
- funcall
- description
- save-window-excursion
- switch-to-buffer
- buffer-string


- let (()): value assigned immediately
- let*: lets happen sequentially, not in parallel; allow vars to rely on previous assigns
- let:
-
